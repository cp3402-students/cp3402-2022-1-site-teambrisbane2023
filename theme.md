# Features

## MiriPiri Cleaning

We used a plugin called "Child Theme Configurator"  which is a fast and easy-to-use utility that allows you to analyze any theme for common problems, create a child theme and customize it beyond the options of the Customizer. Using this, we created a child theme "MiriPiri Services" using the Cleaning Master as the parent theme.

The following information was added to the child theme:
 
**Theme Name** : MiriPiri Servicesr <br>
**Theme URL** : https://www.buywpthemes.net/products/free-cleaning-services-wordpress-theme <br>
**Description**: A child theme of Cleaning Master theme <br>
**Template** : cleaning-master <br>
**Author** : TeamBrisbane <br> 
**Auther URL** : https://www.buywpthemes.net/ <br>
**Version** : 1.0.0 <br>

6.	Right-click on the element you want to modify (e.g., text, colour, layout) on your website.

12.	Double-click on a CSS value to edit it. Press Enter to apply the change temporarily. Note that these changes will only affect your current browser session and won't be saved to your theme files.
13.	Observe the live preview of your changes in the browser.
14.	If satisfied, take note of the CSS changes you've made.
15.	Open your WordPress dashboard.
16.	Go to Appearance » Theme Editor.
