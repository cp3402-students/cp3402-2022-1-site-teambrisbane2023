  <h2>Local Environments</h2>
  <p>Brief description of local environments used by team members
  We programmers were able to deploy a local web server on our home PCs thanks to the popular web development environments XAMPP and MAMP. Because it includes the Apache web server, MariaDB database, PHP, FileZilla, and Perl, the XAMPP package provides a complete solution for developing dynamic web applications. The team members set up a local development environment for a website for student housing on our personal computers using XAMPP. The XAMPP programme is first downloaded and installed. After installation, we set up the Apache web server and jcubhomefinder database. WordPress requires Apache, MySQL, and PHP, which are all components of XAMPP.
    XAMPP's "htdocs" folder is where the contents of the most recent WordPress installation from WordPress.org were extracted.
  This folder is located in the XAMPP installation directory, which is often "C:xampphtdocs" on Windows or "/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs" on a Mac. My browser was opened, and I navigated to "localhost/phpmyadmin." Make a new database for your WordPress website. Note down the username, password, and database name (jcubhomefinder) for later use. To access the WordPress folder in XAMPP, navigate to "localhost/wordpress" in the "htdocs" folder using your web browser. Enter the username, password, and name of the database as directed by the installation wizard.After the setup was finished, we customised our WordPress site and added themes, plugins, and content as necessary. 
    We would swap the database files and ask each member to make a contribution in order to make sure that everyone contributed something.
  To upload the website files to the live server they would utilised FTP file transfer software. 
    In sumarry, XAMPP was integrated with WordPress by providing a local development environment for WordPress. 
    XAMPP included the necessary components to run WordPress, and WordPress was installed and customized in the XAMPP "htdocs" folder. 
    This allowed us to create and test WordPress sites locally before deploying them to a live server.
    For theme development, we used a remote repository in VS Code and pushed the chages from there.<br>
